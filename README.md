# Random Quote Machine

To run the project first

- cd server
- npm install
- npm start

Now that the server is running, you'll be to get new random quotes

# New Tasks

- Create a dropdown to select a particular game title and then only receive quotes from that game
  Use this new endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/quote/game?title=elden+ring"
  I'd like to have the following games in the dropdown:
  - elden ring
  - mass effect 3
  - horizon zero dawn
  - animal crossing new horizons
- Leave an option in the dropdown at the top that is still "Random" that the page defaults to
- When a new game is selected in the dropdown change the background of the page, either to a color that better represents the game or an image
  - BONUS: When the background changes make it a smooth transition
